# DS 4320 - Homework Set #1

In this course every homework set has three parts.
1. Reading - material to explain the context of the homework
2. Data - an abridged data set called "study data" that is used for the problems and is modified/inspired by the original
3. Problems - Several problems for the student to work. These will be explored in class and make up the bulk of the exams.
